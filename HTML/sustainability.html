</p>
<p>
  We at Rainydays are conscious of our social responsibilities with regards to
  helping the environment through our working practices. Our objective is not
  only to sustain our environment for our descendants but also to rehabilitate
  the damage previously done. We believe that our corporate responsibility goes
  beyond our proprietary borders and therefore every effort will be made to
  conserve resources throughout our operations.
</p>

<p>
  Rainydays will try to not only meet existing environmental laws and
  regulation, but will endeavour to go beyond the status quo and see techniques
  and approaches that position us ahead of our competition.
</p>

<p>
  Growth of our company depends on our abilities to minimise or eliminate our
  impacts on our surroundings. Our ultimate success depends on the environment
  of the United Kingdom, without a beautiful country, our customers will cease
  to come. Our companyâ€™s future and the future of our environment are
  interconnected.
</p>

<h2>Following are our specific ideals:</h2>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Energy & Water Consumption</h3>
<p>
  Rainydays accepts a share of the UK's commitment to a reduction in carbon
  dioxide emissions both by attaining greater efficiency in total energy
  consumption and by continuing to examine the possibility of acquiring
  electricity from 'green' sources when finances permit, either through the
  purchase of 'green' electricity, or through an increased use of solar water
  heating, combined heat and power plants (CHP), or photo-voltaic.
</p>

<h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>

  <li>
    Rainydays will make every effort to use water efficiently and avoid
    pollutants entering the drainage system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rainydays will use energy efficient products where ever practical, and
    monitor usage to achieve minimum energy consumption.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Waste Generation and Management</h3>

<p>
  Rainydays will try to minimize the production of waste and pollution;
  including unnecessary packaging. Rainydays will implement measures to reduce
  the volume of waste generated and to increase the proportion of that waste
  which is recycled.
</p>

<h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>

  materials and resources.

    environment, and wherever possible use locally made recycled goods.
  </li>

    environment, and take into account lifetime costs of materials when
    repairing, altering or rebuilding premises.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rainydays will maximize use of electronic communication and information
    storage as an alternative to paper, and take into account the environmental
    quality and impact of food products and where possible to purchase food
    which has been grown locally.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Natural Environment</h3>

<p>
  Rainydays will help to protect and enhance natural habitats and wildlife, take
  appropriate opportunities to enhance them and be sensitive to landscape
  issues. Look to minimize impact on local wildlife, and to look for
  opportunities to work with the local community in caring for the local
  environment. Rainydays will endeavour to be aware of local planning
  developments and take appropriate action where these are potentially damaging
  to the environment.
